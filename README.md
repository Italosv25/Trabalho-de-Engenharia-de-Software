This repository contains a software engineering project developed as part of my academic coursework. The main objective of this project is to apply fundamental principles of software engineering — including requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, version control, and documentation — to build a functional and well-structured application.

The project follows established industry practices such as modular development, clean architecture, coding standards, and continuous improvement. Throughout the development process, multiple engineering activities were performed, such as:

Requirements gathering and specification

System modeling (UML diagrams, architecture design, data modeling)

Implementation using best programming practices

Unit and integration testing

Documentation of features and workflows

Use of Git/GitHub for version control, branching, and collaboration

This repository serves as both a technical submission for university evaluation and a demonstration of software engineering skills applied in a real development scenario.
